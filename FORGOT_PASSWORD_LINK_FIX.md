# Forgot Password Link Fix

## ✅ Task Completed: Fixed Broken Forgot Password Link

### What Was the Problem

The image showed a 404 "Whitelabel Error Page" when trying to access `/auth/forgot.html`. The error message indicated:
- **Error:** `No static resource auth/forgot.html`
- **Status:** 404 Not Found
- **Exception:** `org.springframework.web.servlet.resource.NoResourceFoundException`

### Root Cause Analysis

The issue was in the login page (`auth/login.html`) where the "Forgot Password?" link was pointing to the wrong URL:

**Before (Broken):**
```html
<a href="forgot.html" class="text-sm text-purple-600 hover:text-purple-800 mt-2 inline-block">
    Forgot Password?
</a>
```

**Problem:** This was trying to access a static HTML file at `/auth/forgot.html`, which doesn't exist.

### Solution Applied

**Fixed the link to use the proper controller route:**

**After (Fixed):**
```html
<a href="/auth/forgot" class="text-sm text-purple-600 hover:text-purple-800 mt-2 inline-block">
    Forgot Password?
</a>
```

### Technical Details

1. **Controller Route:** `/auth/forgot` is handled by `AuthController.showForgotPasswordForm()`
2. **Template:** Returns `auth/forgot` template
3. **Static Route:** `/forgot.html` is also available as a static file
4. **Proper Routing:** Now uses Spring MVC controller instead of static resource

### Testing Results

✅ **Controller Route:** `/auth/forgot` returns 200 OK  
✅ **Login Page:** `/auth/login` returns 200 OK  
✅ **Link Fixed:** "Forgot Password?" link now points to correct route  
✅ **No More 404:** The 404 error is resolved  

### User Flow Now Working

1. User visits login page (`/auth/login`)
2. User clicks "Forgot Password?" link
3. Link correctly navigates to `/auth/forgot` (controller route)
4. Forgot password page loads with consistent design
5. User can complete the 3-step password reset process

### Benefits Achieved

1. **No More 404 Errors:** Proper routing eliminates the Whitelabel Error Page
2. **Consistent User Experience:** Seamless navigation between login and forgot password
3. **Proper MVC Architecture:** Uses controller routes instead of static file paths
4. **Maintainable Code:** Centralized routing through Spring controllers

The forgot password functionality is now fully working with proper routing and consistent design.
